## Discussion

> ### Big O Notation
>
> #### Time
>
> - We say that an algorithm is **O(f(n))** if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times **f(n)** as **n** increase
> - Different machines will record different times
> - The same machine will record different times
> - For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough
> - Talks about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow
> - Focuses on trends
>
> #### Shorthands
>
> - Arithmetic operations are constant
> - Variable assignment is constant
> - Accessing elements in any array or object by index or key respectively is constant
> - In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop
